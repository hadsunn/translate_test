PostgreSQL supports the full set of SQL date and time types, shown in [Table
8.9](datatype-datetime.html#DATATYPE-DATETIME-TABLE "Table 8.9. Date/Time
Types"). The operations available on these data types are described in
[Section 9.9](functions-datetime.html "9.9. Date/Time Functions and
Operators"). Dates are counted according to the Gregorian calendar, even in
years before that calendar was introduced (see [Section B.6](datetime-units-
history.html "B.6. History of Units") for more information).

**Table  8.9. Date/Time Types**

Name | Storage Size | Description | Low Value | High Value | Resolution  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
`timestamp [ (_`p`_) ] [ without time zone ]` | 8 bytes | both date and time (no time zone) | 4713 BC | 294276 AD | 1 microsecond  
`timestamp [ (_`p`_) ] with time zone` | 8 bytes | both date and time, with time zone | 4713 BC | 294276 AD | 1 microsecond  
`date` | 4 bytes | date (no time of day) | 4713 BC | 5874897 AD | 1 day  
`time [ (_`p`_) ] [ without time zone ]` | 8 bytes | time of day (no date) | 00:00:00 | 24:00:00 | 1 microsecond  
`time [ (_`p`_) ] with time zone` | 12 bytes | time of day (no date), with time zone | 00:00:00+1559 | 24:00:00-1559 | 1 microsecond  
`interval [ _`fields`_ ] [ (_`p`_) ]` | 16 bytes | time interval | -178000000 years | 178000000 years | 1 microsecond  
  
  

### Note

The SQL standard requires that writing just `timestamp` be equivalent to
`timestamp without time zone`, and PostgreSQL honors that behavior.
`timestamptz` is accepted as an abbreviation for `timestamp with time zone`;
this is a PostgreSQL extension.

`time`, `timestamp`, and `interval` accept an optional precision value _`p`_
which specifies the number of fractional digits retained in the seconds field.
By default, there is no explicit bound on precision. The allowed range of
_`p`_ is from 0 to 6.

The `interval` type has an additional option, which is to restrict the set of
stored fields by writing one of these phrases:

    
    
    YEAR
    MONTH
    DAY
    HOUR
    MINUTE
    SECOND
    YEAR TO MONTH
    DAY TO HOUR
    DAY TO MINUTE
    DAY TO SECOND
    HOUR TO MINUTE
    HOUR TO SECOND
    MINUTE TO SECOND
    

Note that if both _`fields`_ and _`p`_ are specified, the _`fields`_ must
include `SECOND`, since the precision applies only to the seconds.

The type `time with time zone` is defined by the SQL standard, but the
definition exhibits properties which lead to questionable usefulness. In most
cases, a combination of `date`, `time`, `timestamp without time zone`, and
`timestamp with time zone` should provide a complete range of date/time
functionality required by any application.

### 8.5.1. Date/Time Input #

Date and time input is accepted in almost any reasonable format, including ISO
8601, SQL-compatible, traditional POSTGRES, and others. For some formats,
ordering of day, month, and year in date input is ambiguous and there is
support for specifying the expected ordering of these fields. Set the
[DateStyle](runtime-config-client.html#GUC-DATESTYLE) parameter to `MDY` to
select month-day-year interpretation, `DMY` to select day-month-year
interpretation, or `YMD` to select year-month-day interpretation.

PostgreSQL is more flexible in handling date/time input than the SQL standard
requires. See [Appendix B](datetime-appendix.html "Appendix B. Date/Time
Support") for the exact parsing rules of date/time input and for the
recognized text fields including months, days of the week, and time zones.

Remember that any date or time literal input needs to be enclosed in single
quotes, like text strings. Refer to [Section 4.1.2.7](sql-syntax-
lexical.html#SQL-SYNTAX-CONSTANTS-GENERIC "4.1.2.7. Constants of Other Types")
for more information. SQL requires the following syntax

    
    
    _type_ [ (_p_) ] '_value_ '
    

where _`p`_ is an optional precision specification giving the number of
fractional digits in the seconds field. Precision can be specified for `time`,
`timestamp`, and `interval` types, and can range from 0 to 6. If no precision
is specified in a constant specification, it defaults to the precision of the
literal value (but not more than 6 digits).

#### 8.5.1.1. Dates #

[Table 8.10](datatype-datetime.html#DATATYPE-DATETIME-DATE-TABLE
"Table 8.10. Date Input") shows some possible inputs for the `date` type.

**Table  8.10. Date Input**

Example | Description  
---|---  
1999-01-08 | ISO 8601; January 8 in any mode (recommended format)  
January 8, 1999 | unambiguous in any `datestyle` input mode  
1/8/1999 | January 8 in `MDY` mode; August 1 in `DMY` mode  
1/18/1999 | January 18 in `MDY` mode; rejected in other modes  
01/02/03 | January 2, 2003 in `MDY` mode; February 1, 2003 in `DMY` mode; February 3, 2001 in `YMD` mode  
1999-Jan-08 | January 8 in any mode  
Jan-08-1999 | January 8 in any mode  
08-Jan-1999 | January 8 in any mode  
99-Jan-08 | January 8 in `YMD` mode, else error  
08-Jan-99 | January 8, except error in `YMD` mode  
Jan-08-99 | January 8, except error in `YMD` mode  
19990108 | ISO 8601; January 8, 1999 in any mode  
990108 | ISO 8601; January 8, 1999 in any mode  
1999.008 | year and day of year  
J2451187 | Julian date  
January 8, 99 BC | year 99 BC  
  
  

#### 8.5.1.2. Times #

The time-of-day types are `time [ (_`p`_) ] without time zone` and `time [
(_`p`_) ] with time zone`. `time` alone is equivalent to `time without time
zone`.

Valid input for these types consists of a time of day followed by an optional
time zone. (See [Table 8.11](datatype-datetime.html#DATATYPE-DATETIME-TIME-
TABLE "Table 8.11. Time Input") and [Table 8.12](datatype-
datetime.html#DATATYPE-TIMEZONE-TABLE "Table 8.12. Time Zone Input").) If a
time zone is specified in the input for `time without time zone`, it is
silently ignored. You can also specify a date but it will be ignored, except
when you use a time zone name that involves a daylight-savings rule, such as
`America/New_York`. In this case specifying the date is required in order to
determine whether standard or daylight-savings time applies. The appropriate
time zone offset is recorded in the `time with time zone` value and is output
as stored; it is not adjusted to the active time zone.

**Table  8.11. Time Input**

Example | Description  
---|---  
`04:05:06.789` | ISO 8601  
`04:05:06` | ISO 8601  
`04:05` | ISO 8601  
`040506` | ISO 8601  
`04:05 AM` | same as 04:05; AM does not affect value  
`04:05 PM` | same as 16:05; input hour must be <= 12  
`04:05:06.789-8` | ISO 8601, with time zone as UTC offset  
`04:05:06-08:00` | ISO 8601, with time zone as UTC offset  
`04:05-08:00` | ISO 8601, with time zone as UTC offset  
`040506-08` | ISO 8601, with time zone as UTC offset  
`040506+0730` | ISO 8601, with fractional-hour time zone as UTC offset  
`040506+07:30:00` | UTC offset specified to seconds (not allowed in ISO 8601)  
`04:05:06 PST` | time zone specified by abbreviation  
`2003-04-12 04:05:06 America/New_York` | time zone specified by full name  
  
  

**Table  8.12. Time Zone Input**

Example | Description  
---|---  
`PST` | Abbreviation (for Pacific Standard Time)  
`America/New_York` | Full time zone name  
`PST8PDT` | POSIX-style time zone specification  
`-8:00:00` | UTC offset for PST  
`-8:00` | UTC offset for PST (ISO 8601 extended format)  
`-800` | UTC offset for PST (ISO 8601 basic format)  
`-8` | UTC offset for PST (ISO 8601 basic format)  
`zulu` | Military abbreviation for UTC  
`z` | Short form of `zulu` (also in ISO 8601)  
  
  

Refer to [Section 8.5.3](datatype-datetime.html#DATATYPE-TIMEZONES
"8.5.3. Time Zones") for more information on how to specify time zones.

#### 8.5.1.3. Time Stamps #

Valid input for the time stamp types consists of the concatenation of a date
and a time, followed by an optional time zone, followed by an optional `AD` or
`BC`. (Alternatively, `AD`/`BC` can appear before the time zone, but this is
not the preferred ordering.) Thus:

    
    
    1999-01-08 04:05:06
    

and:

    
    
    1999-01-08 04:05:06 -8:00
    

are valid values, which follow the ISO 8601 standard. In addition, the common
format:

    
    
    January 8 04:05:06 1999 PST
    

is supported.

The SQL standard differentiates `timestamp without time zone` and `timestamp
with time zone` literals by the presence of a “+” or “-” symbol and time zone
offset after the time. Hence, according to the standard,

    
    
    TIMESTAMP '2004-10-19 10:23:54'
    

is a `timestamp without time zone`, while

    
    
    TIMESTAMP '2004-10-19 10:23:54+02'
    

is a `timestamp with time zone`. PostgreSQL never examines the content of a
literal string before determining its type, and therefore will treat both of
the above as `timestamp without time zone`. To ensure that a literal is
treated as `timestamp with time zone`, give it the correct explicit type:

    
    
    TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE '2004-10-19 10:23:54+02'
    

In a value that has been determined to be `timestamp without time zone`,
PostgreSQL will silently ignore any time zone indication. That is, the
resulting value is derived from the date/time fields in the input string, and
is not adjusted for time zone.

For `timestamp with time zone` values, an input string that includes an
explicit time zone will be converted to UTC ([](glossary.html#GLOSSARY-
UTC)[Universal Coordinated Time](glossary.html#GLOSSARY-UTC "UTC")) using the
appropriate offset for that time zone. If no time zone is stated in the input
string, then it is assumed to be in the time zone indicated by the system's
[TimeZone](runtime-config-client.html#GUC-TIMEZONE) parameter, and is
converted to UTC using the offset for the `timezone` zone. In either case, the
value is stored internally as UTC, and the originally stated or assumed time
zone is not retained.

When a `timestamp with time zone` value is output, it is always converted from
UTC to the current `timezone` zone, and displayed as local time in that zone.
To see the time in another time zone, either change `timezone` or use the `AT
TIME ZONE` construct (see [Section 9.9.4](functions-datetime.html#FUNCTIONS-
DATETIME-ZONECONVERT "9.9.4. AT TIME ZONE")).

Conversions between `timestamp without time zone` and `timestamp with time
zone` normally assume that the `timestamp without time zone` value should be
taken or given as `timezone` local time. A different time zone can be
specified for the conversion using `AT TIME ZONE`.

#### 8.5.1.4. Special Values #

PostgreSQL supports several special date/time input values for convenience, as
shown in [Table 8.13](datatype-datetime.html#DATATYPE-DATETIME-SPECIAL-TABLE
"Table 8.13. Special Date/Time Inputs"). The values `infinity` and `-infinity`
are specially represented inside the system and will be displayed unchanged;
but the others are simply notational shorthands that will be converted to
ordinary date/time values when read. (In particular, `now` and related strings
are converted to a specific time value as soon as they are read.) All of these
values need to be enclosed in single quotes when used as constants in SQL
commands.

**Table  8.13. Special Date/Time Inputs**

Input String | Valid Types | Description  
---|---|---  
`epoch` | `date`, `timestamp` | 1970-01-01 00:00:00+00 (Unix system time zero)  
`infinity` | `date`, `timestamp` | later than all other time stamps  
`-infinity` | `date`, `timestamp` | earlier than all other time stamps  
`now` | `date`, `time`, `timestamp` | current transaction's start time  
`today` | `date`, `timestamp` | midnight (`00:00`) today  
`tomorrow` | `date`, `timestamp` | midnight (`00:00`) tomorrow  
`yesterday` | `date`, `timestamp` | midnight (`00:00`) yesterday  
`allballs` | `time` | 00:00:00.00 UTC  
  
  

The following SQL-compatible functions can also be used to obtain the current
time value for the corresponding data type: `CURRENT_DATE`, `CURRENT_TIME`,
`CURRENT_TIMESTAMP`, `LOCALTIME`, `LOCALTIMESTAMP`. (See [Section
9.9.5](functions-datetime.html#FUNCTIONS-DATETIME-CURRENT "9.9.5. Current
Date/Time").) Note that these are SQL functions and are _not_ recognized in
data input strings.

### Caution

While the input strings `now`, `today`, `tomorrow`, and `yesterday` are fine
to use in interactive SQL commands, they can have surprising behavior when the
command is saved to be executed later, for example in prepared statements,
views, and function definitions. The string can be converted to a specific
time value that continues to be used long after it becomes stale. Use one of
the SQL functions instead in such contexts. For example, `CURRENT_DATE + 1` is
safer than `'tomorrow'::date`.

### 8.5.2. Date/Time Output #

The output format of the date/time types can be set to one of the four styles
ISO 8601, SQL (Ingres), traditional POSTGRES (Unix date format), or German.
The default is the ISO format. (The SQL standard requires the use of the ISO
8601 format. The name of the “SQL” output format is a historical accident.)
[Table 8.14](datatype-datetime.html#DATATYPE-DATETIME-OUTPUT-TABLE
"Table 8.14. Date/Time Output Styles") shows examples of each output style.
The output of the `date` and `time` types is generally only the date or time
part in accordance with the given examples. However, the POSTGRES style
outputs date-only values in ISO format.

**Table  8.14. Date/Time Output Styles**

Style Specification | Description | Example  
---|---|---  
`ISO` | ISO 8601, SQL standard | `1997-12-17 07:37:16-08`  
`SQL` | traditional style | `12/17/1997 07:37:16.00 PST`  
`Postgres` | original style | `Wed Dec 17 07:37:16 1997 PST`  
`German` | regional style | `17.12.1997 07:37:16.00 PST`  
  
  

### Note

ISO 8601 specifies the use of uppercase letter `T` to separate the date and
time. PostgreSQL accepts that format on input, but on output it uses a space
rather than `T`, as shown above. This is for readability and for consistency
with [RFC 3339](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc3339) as well as some
other database systems.

In the SQL and POSTGRES styles, day appears before month if DMY field ordering
has been specified, otherwise month appears before day. (See [Section
8.5.1](datatype-datetime.html#DATATYPE-DATETIME-INPUT "8.5.1. Date/Time
Input") for how this setting also affects interpretation of input values.)
[Table 8.15](datatype-datetime.html#DATATYPE-DATETIME-OUTPUT2-TABLE
"Table 8.15. Date Order Conventions") shows examples.

**Table  8.15. Date Order Conventions**

`datestyle` Setting | Input Ordering | Example Output  
---|---|---  
`SQL, DMY` | _`day`_ /_`month`_ /_`year`_ | `17/12/1997 15:37:16.00 CET`  
`SQL, MDY` | _`month`_ /_`day`_ /_`year`_ | `12/17/1997 07:37:16.00 PST`  
`Postgres, DMY` | _`day`_ /_`month`_ /_`year`_ | `Wed 17 Dec 07:37:16 1997 PST`  
  
  

In the ISO style, the time zone is always shown as a signed numeric offset
from UTC, with positive sign used for zones east of Greenwich. The offset will
be shown as _`hh`_ (hours only) if it is an integral number of hours, else as
_`hh`_ :_`mm`_ if it is an integral number of minutes, else as _`hh`_ :_`mm`_
:_`ss`_. (The third case is not possible with any modern time zone standard,
but it can appear when working with timestamps that predate the adoption of
standardized time zones.) In the other date styles, the time zone is shown as
an alphabetic abbreviation if one is in common use in the current zone.
Otherwise it appears as a signed numeric offset in ISO 8601 basic format
(_`hh`_ or _`hhmm`_).

The date/time style can be selected by the user using the `SET datestyle`
command, the [DateStyle](runtime-config-client.html#GUC-DATESTYLE) parameter
in the `postgresql.conf` configuration file, or the `PGDATESTYLE` environment
variable on the server or client.

The formatting function `to_char` (see [Section 9.8](functions-formatting.html
"9.8. Data Type Formatting Functions")) is also available as a more flexible
way to format date/time output.

### 8.5.3. Time Zones #

Time zones, and time-zone conventions, are influenced by political decisions,
not just earth geometry. Time zones around the world became somewhat
standardized during the 1900s, but continue to be prone to arbitrary changes,
particularly with respect to daylight-savings rules. PostgreSQL uses the
widely-used IANA (Olson) time zone database for information about historical
time zone rules. For times in the future, the assumption is that the latest
known rules for a given time zone will continue to be observed indefinitely
far into the future.

PostgreSQL endeavors to be compatible with the SQL standard definitions for
typical usage. However, the SQL standard has an odd mix of date and time types
and capabilities. Two obvious problems are:

  * Although the `date` type cannot have an associated time zone, the `time` type can. Time zones in the real world have little meaning unless associated with a date as well as a time, since the offset can vary through the year with daylight-saving time boundaries.

  * The default time zone is specified as a constant numeric offset from UTC. It is therefore impossible to adapt to daylight-saving time when doing date/time arithmetic across DST boundaries.

To address these difficulties, we recommend using date/time types that contain
both date and time when using time zones. We do _not_ recommend using the type
`time with time zone` (though it is supported by PostgreSQL for legacy
applications and for compliance with the SQL standard). PostgreSQL assumes
your local time zone for any type containing only date or time.

All timezone-aware dates and times are stored internally in UTC. They are
converted to local time in the zone specified by the [TimeZone](runtime-
config-client.html#GUC-TIMEZONE) configuration parameter before being
displayed to the client.

PostgreSQL allows you to specify time zones in three different forms:

  * A full time zone name, for example `America/New_York`. The recognized time zone names are listed in the `pg_timezone_names` view (see [Section 54.32](view-pg-timezone-names.html "54.32. pg_timezone_names")). PostgreSQL uses the widely-used IANA time zone data for this purpose, so the same time zone names are also recognized by other software.

  * A time zone abbreviation, for example `PST`. Such a specification merely defines a particular offset from UTC, in contrast to full time zone names which can imply a set of daylight savings transition rules as well. The recognized abbreviations are listed in the `pg_timezone_abbrevs` view (see [Section 54.31](view-pg-timezone-abbrevs.html "54.31. pg_timezone_abbrevs")). You cannot set the configuration parameters [TimeZone](runtime-config-client.html#GUC-TIMEZONE) or [log_timezone](runtime-config-logging.html#GUC-LOG-TIMEZONE) to a time zone abbreviation, but you can use abbreviations in date/time input values and with the `AT TIME ZONE` operator.

  * In addition to the timezone names and abbreviations, PostgreSQL will accept POSIX-style time zone specifications, as described in [Section B.5](datetime-posix-timezone-specs.html "B.5. POSIX Time Zone Specifications"). This option is not normally preferable to using a named time zone, but it may be necessary if no suitable IANA time zone entry is available.

In short, this is the difference between abbreviations and full names:
abbreviations represent a specific offset from UTC, whereas many of the full
names imply a local daylight-savings time rule, and so have two possible UTC
offsets. As an example, `2014-06-04 12:00 America/New_York` represents noon
local time in New York, which for this particular date was Eastern Daylight
Time (UTC-4). So `2014-06-04 12:00 EDT` specifies that same time instant. But
`2014-06-04 12:00 EST` specifies noon Eastern Standard Time (UTC-5),
regardless of whether daylight savings was nominally in effect on that date.

To complicate matters, some jurisdictions have used the same timezone
abbreviation to mean different UTC offsets at different times; for example, in
Moscow `MSK` has meant UTC+3 in some years and UTC+4 in others. PostgreSQL
interprets such abbreviations according to whatever they meant (or had most
recently meant) on the specified date; but, as with the `EST` example above,
this is not necessarily the same as local civil time on that date.

In all cases, timezone names and abbreviations are recognized case-
insensitively. (This is a change from PostgreSQL versions prior to 8.2, which
were case-sensitive in some contexts but not others.)

Neither timezone names nor abbreviations are hard-wired into the server; they
are obtained from configuration files stored under `.../share/timezone/` and
`.../share/timezonesets/` of the installation directory (see [Section
B.4](datetime-config-files.html "B.4. Date/Time Configuration Files")).

The [TimeZone](runtime-config-client.html#GUC-TIMEZONE) configuration
parameter can be set in the file `postgresql.conf`, or in any of the other
standard ways described in [Chapter 20](runtime-config.html
"Chapter 20. Server Configuration"). There are also some special ways to set
it:

  * The SQL command `SET TIME ZONE` sets the time zone for the session. This is an alternative spelling of `SET TIMEZONE TO` with a more SQL-spec-compatible syntax.

  * The `PGTZ` environment variable is used by libpq clients to send a `SET TIME ZONE` command to the server upon connection.

### 8.5.4. Interval Input #

`interval` values can be written using the following verbose syntax:

    
    
    [@] _quantity_ _unit_ [_quantity_ _unit_...] [_direction_]
    

where _`quantity`_ is a number (possibly signed); _`unit`_ is `microsecond`,
`millisecond`, `second`, `minute`, `hour`, `day`, `week`, `month`, `year`,
`decade`, `century`, `millennium`, or abbreviations or plurals of these units;
_`direction`_ can be `ago` or empty. The at sign (`@`) is optional noise. The
amounts of the different units are implicitly added with appropriate sign
accounting. `ago` negates all the fields. This syntax is also used for
interval output, if [IntervalStyle](runtime-config-client.html#GUC-
INTERVALSTYLE) is set to `postgres_verbose`.

Quantities of days, hours, minutes, and seconds can be specified without
explicit unit markings. For example, `'1 12:59:10'` is read the same as `'1
day 12 hours 59 min 10 sec'`. Also, a combination of years and months can be
specified with a dash; for example `'200-10'` is read the same as `'200 years
10 months'`. (These shorter forms are in fact the only ones allowed by the SQL
standard, and are used for output when `IntervalStyle` is set to
`sql_standard`.)

Interval values can also be written as ISO 8601 time intervals, using either
the “format with designators” of the standard's section 4.4.3.2 or the
“alternative format” of section 4.4.3.3. The format with designators looks
like this:

    
    
    P _quantity_ _unit_ [ _quantity_ _unit_ ...] [ T [ _quantity_ _unit_ ...]]
    

The string must start with a `P`, and may include a `T` that introduces the
time-of-day units. The available unit abbreviations are given in [Table
8.16](datatype-datetime.html#DATATYPE-INTERVAL-ISO8601-UNITS "Table 8.16. ISO
8601 Interval Unit Abbreviations"). Units may be omitted, and may be specified
in any order, but units smaller than a day must appear after `T`. In
particular, the meaning of `M` depends on whether it is before or after `T`.

**Table  8.16. ISO 8601 Interval Unit Abbreviations**

Abbreviation | Meaning  
---|---  
Y | Years  
M | Months (in the date part)  
W | Weeks  
D | Days  
H | Hours  
M | Minutes (in the time part)  
S | Seconds  
  
  

In the alternative format:

    
    
    P [ _years_ -_months_ -_days_ ] [ T _hours_ :_minutes_ :_seconds_ ]
    

the string must begin with `P`, and a `T` separates the date and time parts of
the interval. The values are given as numbers similar to ISO 8601 dates.

When writing an interval constant with a _`fields`_ specification, or when
assigning a string to an interval column that was defined with a _`fields`_
specification, the interpretation of unmarked quantities depends on the
_`fields`_. For example `INTERVAL '1' YEAR` is read as 1 year, whereas
`INTERVAL '1'` means 1 second. Also, field values “to the right” of the least
significant field allowed by the _`fields`_ specification are silently
discarded. For example, writing `INTERVAL '1 day 2:03:04' HOUR TO MINUTE`
results in dropping the seconds field, but not the day field.

According to the SQL standard all fields of an interval value must have the
same sign, so a leading negative sign applies to all fields; for example the
negative sign in the interval literal `'-1 2:03:04'` applies to both the days
and hour/minute/second parts. PostgreSQL allows the fields to have different
signs, and traditionally treats each field in the textual representation as
independently signed, so that the hour/minute/second part is considered
positive in this example. If `IntervalStyle` is set to `sql_standard` then a
leading sign is considered to apply to all fields (but only if no additional
signs appear). Otherwise the traditional PostgreSQL interpretation is used. To
avoid ambiguity, it's recommended to attach an explicit sign to each field if
any field is negative.

Internally, `interval` values are stored as three integral fields: months,
days, and microseconds. These fields are kept separate because the number of
days in a month varies, while a day can have 23 or 25 hours if a daylight
savings time transition is involved. An interval input string that uses other
units is normalized into this format, and then reconstructed in a standardized
way for output, for example:

    
    
    SELECT '2 years 15 months 100 weeks 99 hours 123456789 milliseconds'::interval;
                   interval
    ---------------------------------------
     3 years 3 mons 700 days 133:17:36.789
    

Here weeks, which are understood as “7 days”, have been kept separate, while
the smaller and larger time units were combined and normalized.

Input field values can have fractional parts, for example `'1.5 weeks'` or
`'01:02:03.45'`. However, because `interval` internally stores only integral
fields, fractional values must be converted into smaller units. Fractional
parts of units greater than months are rounded to be an integer number of
months, e.g. `'1.5 years'` becomes `'1 year 6 mons'`. Fractional parts of
weeks and days are computed to be an integer number of days and microseconds,
assuming 30 days per month and 24 hours per day, e.g., `'1.75 months'` becomes
`1 mon 22 days 12:00:00`. Only seconds will ever be shown as fractional on
output.

[Table 8.17](datatype-datetime.html#DATATYPE-INTERVAL-INPUT-EXAMPLES
"Table 8.17. Interval Input") shows some examples of valid `interval` input.

**Table  8.17. Interval Input**

Example | Description  
---|---  
`1-2` | SQL standard format: 1 year 2 months  
`3 4:05:06` | SQL standard format: 3 days 4 hours 5 minutes 6 seconds  
`1 year 2 months 3 days 4 hours 5 minutes 6 seconds` | Traditional Postgres format: 1 year 2 months 3 days 4 hours 5 minutes 6 seconds  
`P1Y2M3DT4H5M6S` | ISO 8601 “format with designators”: same meaning as above  
`P0001-02-03T04:05:06` | ISO 8601 “alternative format”: same meaning as above  
  
  

### 8.5.5. Interval Output #

As previously explained, PostgreSQL stores `interval` values as months, days,
and microseconds. For output, the months field is converted to years and
months by dividing by 12. The days field is shown as-is. The microseconds
field is converted to hours, minutes, seconds, and fractional seconds. Thus
months, minutes, and seconds will never be shown as exceeding the ranges 0–11,
0–59, and 0–59 respectively, while the displayed years, days, and hours fields
can be quite large. (The [`justify_days`](functions-datetime.html#FUNCTION-
JUSTIFY-DAYS) and [`justify_hours`](functions-datetime.html#FUNCTION-JUSTIFY-
HOURS) functions can be used if it is desirable to transpose large days or
hours values into the next higher field.)

The output format of the interval type can be set to one of the four styles
`sql_standard`, `postgres`, `postgres_verbose`, or `iso_8601`, using the
command `SET intervalstyle`. The default is the `postgres` format. [Table
8.18](datatype-datetime.html#INTERVAL-STYLE-OUTPUT-TABLE "Table 8.18. Interval
Output Style Examples") shows examples of each output style.

The `sql_standard` style produces output that conforms to the SQL standard's
specification for interval literal strings, if the interval value meets the
standard's restrictions (either year-month only or day-time only, with no
mixing of positive and negative components). Otherwise the output looks like a
standard year-month literal string followed by a day-time literal string, with
explicit signs added to disambiguate mixed-sign intervals.

The output of the `postgres` style matches the output of PostgreSQL releases
prior to 8.4 when the [DateStyle](runtime-config-client.html#GUC-DATESTYLE)
parameter was set to `ISO`.

The output of the `postgres_verbose` style matches the output of PostgreSQL
releases prior to 8.4 when the `DateStyle` parameter was set to non-`ISO`
output.

The output of the `iso_8601` style matches the “format with designators”
described in section 4.4.3.2 of the ISO 8601 standard.

**Table  8.18. Interval Output Style Examples**

Style Specification | Year-Month Interval | Day-Time Interval | Mixed Interval  
---|---|---|---  
`sql_standard` | 1-2 | 3 4:05:06 | -1-2 +3 -4:05:06  
`postgres` | 1 year 2 mons | 3 days 04:05:06 | -1 year -2 mons +3 days -04:05:06  
`postgres_verbose` | @ 1 year 2 mons | @ 3 days 4 hours 5 mins 6 secs | @ 1 year 2 mons -3 days 4 hours 5 mins 6 secs ago  
`iso_8601` | P1Y2M | P3DT4H5M6S | P-1Y-2M3D​T-4H-5M-6S
