## 56.2. Reporting Errors Within the Server #

Error, warning, and log messages generated within the server code should be
created using `ereport`, or its older cousin `elog`. The use of this function
is complex enough to require some explanation.

There are two required elements for every message: a severity level (ranging
from `DEBUG` to `PANIC`) and a primary message text. In addition there are
optional elements, the most common of which is an error identifier code that
follows the SQL spec's SQLSTATE conventions. `ereport` itself is just a shell
macro that exists mainly for the syntactic convenience of making message
generation look like a single function call in the C source code. The only
parameter accepted directly by `ereport` is the severity level. The primary
message text and any optional message elements are generated by calling
auxiliary functions, such as `errmsg`, within the `ereport` call.

A typical call to `ereport` might look like this:

    
    
    ereport(ERROR,
            errcode(ERRCODE_DIVISION_BY_ZERO),
            errmsg("division by zero"));
    

This specifies error severity level `ERROR` (a run-of-the-mill error). The
`errcode` call specifies the SQLSTATE error code using a macro defined in
`src/include/utils/errcodes.h`. The `errmsg` call provides the primary message
text.

You will also frequently see this older style, with an extra set of
parentheses surrounding the auxiliary function calls:

    
    
    ereport(ERROR,
            (errcode(ERRCODE_DIVISION_BY_ZERO),
             errmsg("division by zero")));
    

The extra parentheses were required before PostgreSQL version 12, but are now
optional.

Here is a more complex example:

    
    
    ereport(ERROR,
            errcode(ERRCODE_AMBIGUOUS_FUNCTION),
            errmsg("function %s is not unique",
                   func_signature_string(funcname, nargs,
                                         NIL, actual_arg_types)),
            errhint("Unable to choose a best candidate function. "
                    "You might need to add explicit typecasts."));
    

This illustrates the use of format codes to embed run-time values into a
message text. Also, an optional “hint” message is provided. The auxiliary
function calls can be written in any order, but conventionally `errcode` and
`errmsg` appear first.

If the severity level is `ERROR` or higher, `ereport` aborts execution of the
current query and does not return to the caller. If the severity level is
lower than `ERROR`, `ereport` returns normally.

The available auxiliary routines for `ereport` are:

  * `errcode(sqlerrcode)` specifies the SQLSTATE error identifier code for the condition. If this routine is not called, the error identifier defaults to `ERRCODE_INTERNAL_ERROR` when the error severity level is `ERROR` or higher, `ERRCODE_WARNING` when the error level is `WARNING`, otherwise (for `NOTICE` and below) `ERRCODE_SUCCESSFUL_COMPLETION`. While these defaults are often convenient, always think whether they are appropriate before omitting the `errcode()` call.

  * `errmsg(const char *msg, ...)` specifies the primary error message text, and possibly run-time values to insert into it. Insertions are specified by `sprintf`-style format codes. In addition to the standard format codes accepted by `sprintf`, the format code `%m` can be used to insert the error message returned by `strerror` for the current value of `errno`. [16] `%m` does not require any corresponding entry in the parameter list for `errmsg`. Note that the message string will be run through `gettext` for possible localization before format codes are processed.

  * `errmsg_internal(const char *msg, ...)` is the same as `errmsg`, except that the message string will not be translated nor included in the internationalization message dictionary. This should be used for “cannot happen” cases that are probably not worth expending translation effort on.

  * `errmsg_plural(const char *fmt_singular, const char *fmt_plural, unsigned long n, ...)` is like `errmsg`, but with support for various plural forms of the message. _`fmt_singular`_ is the English singular format, _`fmt_plural`_ is the English plural format, _`n`_ is the integer value that determines which plural form is needed, and the remaining arguments are formatted according to the selected format string. For more information see [Section 57.2.2](nls-programmer.html#NLS-GUIDELINES "57.2.2. Message-Writing Guidelines").

  * `errdetail(const char *msg, ...)` supplies an optional “detail” message; this is to be used when there is additional information that seems inappropriate to put in the primary message. The message string is processed in just the same way as for `errmsg`.

  * `errdetail_internal(const char *msg, ...)` is the same as `errdetail`, except that the message string will not be translated nor included in the internationalization message dictionary. This should be used for detail messages that are not worth expending translation effort on, for instance because they are too technical to be useful to most users.

  * `errdetail_plural(const char *fmt_singular, const char *fmt_plural, unsigned long n, ...)` is like `errdetail`, but with support for various plural forms of the message. For more information see [Section 57.2.2](nls-programmer.html#NLS-GUIDELINES "57.2.2. Message-Writing Guidelines").

  * `errdetail_log(const char *msg, ...)` is the same as `errdetail` except that this string goes only to the server log, never to the client. If both `errdetail` (or one of its equivalents above) and `errdetail_log` are used then one string goes to the client and the other to the log. This is useful for error details that are too security-sensitive or too bulky to include in the report sent to the client.

  * `errdetail_log_plural(const char *fmt_singular, const char *fmt_plural, unsigned long n, ...)` is like `errdetail_log`, but with support for various plural forms of the message. For more information see [Section 57.2.2](nls-programmer.html#NLS-GUIDELINES "57.2.2. Message-Writing Guidelines").

  * `errhint(const char *msg, ...)` supplies an optional “hint” message; this is to be used when offering suggestions about how to fix the problem, as opposed to factual details about what went wrong. The message string is processed in just the same way as for `errmsg`.

  * `errhint_plural(const char *fmt_singular, const char *fmt_plural, unsigned long n, ...)` is like `errhint`, but with support for various plural forms of the message. For more information see [Section 57.2.2](nls-programmer.html#NLS-GUIDELINES "57.2.2. Message-Writing Guidelines").

  * `errcontext(const char *msg, ...)` is not normally called directly from an `ereport` message site; rather it is used in `error_context_stack` callback functions to provide information about the context in which an error occurred, such as the current location in a PL function. The message string is processed in just the same way as for `errmsg`. Unlike the other auxiliary functions, this can be called more than once per `ereport` call; the successive strings thus supplied are concatenated with separating newlines.

  * `errposition(int cursorpos)` specifies the textual location of an error within a query string. Currently it is only useful for errors detected in the lexical and syntactic analysis phases of query processing.

  * `errtable(Relation rel)` specifies a relation whose name and schema name should be included as auxiliary fields in the error report.

  * `errtablecol(Relation rel, int attnum)` specifies a column whose name, table name, and schema name should be included as auxiliary fields in the error report.

  * `errtableconstraint(Relation rel, const char *conname)` specifies a table constraint whose name, table name, and schema name should be included as auxiliary fields in the error report. Indexes should be considered to be constraints for this purpose, whether or not they have an associated `pg_constraint` entry. Be careful to pass the underlying heap relation, not the index itself, as `rel`.

  * `errdatatype(Oid datatypeOid)` specifies a data type whose name and schema name should be included as auxiliary fields in the error report.

  * `errdomainconstraint(Oid datatypeOid, const char *conname)` specifies a domain constraint whose name, domain name, and schema name should be included as auxiliary fields in the error report.

  * `errcode_for_file_access()` is a convenience function that selects an appropriate SQLSTATE error identifier for a failure in a file-access-related system call. It uses the saved `errno` to determine which error code to generate. Usually this should be used in combination with `%m` in the primary error message text.

  * `errcode_for_socket_access()` is a convenience function that selects an appropriate SQLSTATE error identifier for a failure in a socket-related system call.

  * `errhidestmt(bool hide_stmt)` can be called to specify suppression of the `STATEMENT:` portion of a message in the postmaster log. Generally this is appropriate if the message text includes the current statement already.

  * `errhidecontext(bool hide_ctx)` can be called to specify suppression of the `CONTEXT:` portion of a message in the postmaster log. This should only be used for verbose debugging messages where the repeated inclusion of context would bloat the log too much.

### Note

At most one of the functions `errtable`, `errtablecol`, `errtableconstraint`,
`errdatatype`, or `errdomainconstraint` should be used in an `ereport` call.
These functions exist to allow applications to extract the name of a database
object associated with the error condition without having to examine the
potentially-localized error message text. These functions should be used in
error reports for which it's likely that applications would wish to have
automatic error handling. As of PostgreSQL 9.3, complete coverage exists only
for errors in SQLSTATE class 23 (integrity constraint violation), but this is
likely to be expanded in future.

There is an older function `elog` that is still heavily used. An `elog` call:

    
    
    elog(level, "format string", ...);
    

is exactly equivalent to:

    
    
    ereport(level, errmsg_internal("format string", ...));
    

Notice that the SQLSTATE error code is always defaulted, and the message
string is not subject to translation. Therefore, `elog` should be used only
for internal errors and low-level debug logging. Any message that is likely to
be of interest to ordinary users should go through `ereport`. Nonetheless,
there are enough internal “cannot happen” error checks in the system that
`elog` is still widely used; it is preferred for those messages for its
notational simplicity.

[16] That is, the value that was current when the `ereport` call was reached;
changes of `errno` within the auxiliary reporting routines will not affect it.
That would not be true if you were to write `strerror(errno)` explicitly in
`errmsg`'s parameter list; accordingly, do not do so.
