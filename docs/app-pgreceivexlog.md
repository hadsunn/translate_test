## O.5. `pg_receivexlog` renamed to `pg_receivewal` #

PostgreSQL 9.6 and below provided a command named `pg_receivexlog` to fetch
write-ahead-log (WAL) files. This command was renamed to `pg_receivewal`, see
[pg_receivewal](app-pgreceivewal.html "pg_receivewal") for documentation of
`pg_receivewal` and see [the release notes for PostgreSQL 10](release-
prior.html "E.11. Prior Releases") for details on this change.
