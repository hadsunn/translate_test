## ALTER AGGREGATE

ALTER AGGREGATE â€” change the definition of an aggregate function

## Synopsis

    
    
    ALTER AGGREGATE _name_ ( _aggregate_signature_ ) RENAME TO _new_name_
    ALTER AGGREGATE _name_ ( _aggregate_signature_ )
                    OWNER TO { _new_owner_ | CURRENT_ROLE | CURRENT_USER | SESSION_USER }
    ALTER AGGREGATE _name_ ( _aggregate_signature_ ) SET SCHEMA _new_schema_
    
    where _aggregate_signature_ is:
    
    * |
    [ _argmode_ ] [ _argname_ ] _argtype_ [ , ... ] |
    [ [ _argmode_ ] [ _argname_ ] _argtype_ [ , ... ] ] ORDER BY [ _argmode_ ] [ _argname_ ] _argtype_ [ , ... ]
    

## Description

`ALTER AGGREGATE` changes the definition of an aggregate function.

You must own the aggregate function to use `ALTER AGGREGATE`. To change the
schema of an aggregate function, you must also have `CREATE` privilege on the
new schema. To alter the owner, you must be able to `SET ROLE` to the new
owning role, and that role must have `CREATE` privilege on the aggregate
function's schema. (These restrictions enforce that altering the owner doesn't
do anything you couldn't do by dropping and recreating the aggregate function.
However, a superuser can alter ownership of any aggregate function anyway.)

## Parameters

_`name`_

    

The name (optionally schema-qualified) of an existing aggregate function.

_`argmode`_

    

The mode of an argument: `IN` or `VARIADIC`. If omitted, the default is `IN`.

_`argname`_

    

The name of an argument. Note that `ALTER AGGREGATE` does not actually pay any
attention to argument names, since only the argument data types are needed to
determine the aggregate function's identity.

_`argtype`_

    

An input data type on which the aggregate function operates. To reference a
zero-argument aggregate function, write `*` in place of the list of argument
specifications. To reference an ordered-set aggregate function, write `ORDER
BY` between the direct and aggregated argument specifications.

_`new_name`_

    

The new name of the aggregate function.

_`new_owner`_

    

The new owner of the aggregate function.

_`new_schema`_

    

The new schema for the aggregate function.

## Notes

The recommended syntax for referencing an ordered-set aggregate is to write
`ORDER BY` between the direct and aggregated argument specifications, in the
same style as in [`CREATE AGGREGATE`](sql-createaggregate.html "CREATE
AGGREGATE"). However, it will also work to omit `ORDER BY` and just run the
direct and aggregated argument specifications into a single list. In this
abbreviated form, if `VARIADIC "any"` was used in both the direct and
aggregated argument lists, write `VARIADIC "any"` only once.

## Examples

To rename the aggregate function `myavg` for type `integer` to `my_average`:

    
    
    ALTER AGGREGATE myavg(integer) RENAME TO my_average;
    

To change the owner of the aggregate function `myavg` for type `integer` to
`joe`:

    
    
    ALTER AGGREGATE myavg(integer) OWNER TO joe;
    

To move the ordered-set aggregate `mypercentile` with direct argument of type
`float8` and aggregated argument of type `integer` into schema `myschema`:

    
    
    ALTER AGGREGATE mypercentile(float8 ORDER BY integer) SET SCHEMA myschema;
    

This will work too:

    
    
    ALTER AGGREGATE mypercentile(float8, integer) SET SCHEMA myschema;
    

## Compatibility

There is no `ALTER AGGREGATE` statement in the SQL standard.
