## ROLLBACK TO SAVEPOINT

ROLLBACK TO SAVEPOINT â€” roll back to a savepoint

## Synopsis

    
    
    ROLLBACK [ WORK | TRANSACTION ] TO [ SAVEPOINT ] _savepoint_name_
    

## Description

Roll back all commands that were executed after the savepoint was established
and then start a new subtransaction at the same transaction level. The
savepoint remains valid and can be rolled back to again later, if needed.

`ROLLBACK TO SAVEPOINT` implicitly destroys all savepoints that were
established after the named savepoint.

## Parameters

_`savepoint_name`_

    

The savepoint to roll back to.

## Notes

Use [`RELEASE SAVEPOINT`](sql-release-savepoint.html "RELEASE SAVEPOINT") to
destroy a savepoint without discarding the effects of commands executed after
it was established.

Specifying a savepoint name that has not been established is an error.

Cursors have somewhat non-transactional behavior with respect to savepoints.
Any cursor that is opened inside a savepoint will be closed when the savepoint
is rolled back. If a previously opened cursor is affected by a `FETCH` or
`MOVE` command inside a savepoint that is later rolled back, the cursor
remains at the position that `FETCH` left it pointing to (that is, the cursor
motion caused by `FETCH` is not rolled back). Closing a cursor is not undone
by rolling back, either. However, other side-effects caused by the cursor's
query (such as side-effects of volatile functions called by the query) _are_
rolled back if they occur during a savepoint that is later rolled back. A
cursor whose execution causes a transaction to abort is put in a cannot-
execute state, so while the transaction can be restored using `ROLLBACK TO
SAVEPOINT`, the cursor can no longer be used.

## Examples

To undo the effects of the commands executed after `my_savepoint` was
established:

    
    
    ROLLBACK TO SAVEPOINT my_savepoint;
    

Cursor positions are not affected by savepoint rollback:

    
    
    BEGIN;
    
    DECLARE foo CURSOR FOR SELECT 1 UNION SELECT 2;
    
    SAVEPOINT foo;
    
    FETCH 1 FROM foo;
     ?column?
    ----------
            1
    
    ROLLBACK TO SAVEPOINT foo;
    
    FETCH 1 FROM foo;
     ?column?
    ----------
            2
    
    COMMIT;
    

## Compatibility

The SQL standard specifies that the key word `SAVEPOINT` is mandatory, but
PostgreSQL and Oracle allow it to be omitted. SQL allows only `WORK`, not
`TRANSACTION`, as a noise word after `ROLLBACK`. Also, SQL has an optional
clause `AND [ NO ] CHAIN` which is not currently supported by PostgreSQL.
Otherwise, this command conforms to the SQL standard.
